        "question": "Prohibition of forced labour",
        "answer": "The 2008 Constitution states that forced labour is prohibited except hard labour as a punishment \nfor persons convicted of crimes or labour required in a state of emergency with duties assigned \nby the Union in accord with the law (Article 359). Several laws prescribe sanctions for use of forced \nlabour including the Penal Code, Ward or Village Tract Administration Law and Anti-Trafficking in \nPersons Law.Under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law (sections 24 and 25), persons found guilty of \ntrafficking women, children and youth shall be punished with imprisonment from a minimum of ten \nyears to life imprisonment and a fine, while those who are found guilty of trafficking other persons \nshall be punished with imprisonment from a minimum term of five years to a maximum term of ten \nyears, and may also be liable to a fine.\nA person who unlawfully compels any person to labour against the will of that person shall be punished \nwith imprisonment up to one year and/or fined. Anyone who makes someone undertake some work \nor service against his or her will and under threat of punishment shall be liable to an imprisonment \nup to one year and/or fined up to 100,000 kyats. Forced labour, forced service, slavery, servitude and \ndebt-bondage are all forms of exploitation punishable under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law. \nThe following types of activities are also considered forced labour: \n\u2022 public works \u2013 use of the population as labourers to undertake national development \nprojects, such as road construction, bridge building, dam building, etc.;\n\u2022 community service \u2013 Use of people in the repair and maintenance of public structures such \nas schools, government buildings, public gardens, military establishment etc.;\n\u2022 forced and underage recruitment of people or children into the armed forces;\n\u2022 forced portering \u2013 use of people in conflict zones to carry military food rations and \nammunition between locations;\n\u2022 sentry duty \u2013 use of people to be on duty in warfare strategic locations with a demand that \nthey report on enemy intrusion at the given strategic position;\n\u2022 forced labour related to land confiscation \u2013 either where the confiscation of land is used as \na threat to forced labour or the confiscation of their land enables the authorities to exact \nforced labour upon the person / farmers;\n\u2022 forced cropping \u2013 where people are forced to grow a crop not voluntarily chosen;\n\u2022 trafficking;\n\u2022 debt bondage.\nExceptions to forced labour include:\n\u2022 prison labour undertaken under the direct supervision of prison authorities;\n\u2022 humanitarian relief work in emergency situations;\n\u2022 minor communal works;\n\u2022 compulsory military service, where provision of compulsory service is required under the law.\nOvertime is not forced labour provided it is within the limits permitted by national legislation or \ncollective agreements. In Myanmar, legally permitted overtime is 12 hours per week in shops and \nestablishments. In factories, 20 hours per week for non-continuous work. Therefore, forced overtime \nwork in excess of these limitations may be inconsistent with protections against forced labour.9\nIn addition, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommenda-tions \nhas said: \u201cAlthough workers may in theory be able to refuse to work beyond normal working hours, \ntheir vulnerability means that in practice they may have no choice and are obliged to do so in order \nto earn the minimum wage or keep their jobs, or both. In cases in which work or service is imposed \nby exploiting the worker\u2019s vulnerability, under the menace of a penalty, dismissal or payment of \nwages below the minimum level, such exploitation ceases to be merely a matter of poor conditions \nof employment; it becomes one of imposing work under the menace of a penalty which calls for \nprotection of the workers.\u201d\n"

Under the Leave and Holiday Rules, a worker is entitled to the monetary benefit \nin lieu of the annual leave with the average salary or wage.  However, the rules do not specify when \nthis \u201ccash out\u201d can occur.\n Under the Leave and Holidays Act (as amended in 2006), workers forfeit one day of earned leave for \nevery month in which they do not work at least 20 days, with certain absences continuing to count \nas worked days (i.e., illness, injury, authorized absences, voluntary suspension of work, lock-outs, or \nlegal strikes).

Employers and workers are free to modify this policy in \ntheir employment contracts or collective agreements, but may not increase the number beyond 20 \ndays per month.\n Workers who resign or are terminated before using their leave must be paid for unused leave based \non average daily earnings over the last 30 days.  If the worker does not stay for 12 continuous months, \nthe earned leave is granted in proportion to the months worked.  Similarly, leave entitlements for \ntemporary workers shall be decided in proportion to the length of their employment. Payment for \nunused leave must be made to workers within two days.  Payment for unused leave cannot be paid \nout at the commencement of the year; it must be made only after the termination of the contract. "

The Social Security Law applies to all companies with five workers or more (unless exempted), and to workplaces that register voluntarily. An employer, however, shall pay for medical treatment for workplace injuries if there are omissions or criminal action by the employer, or they fail to keep occupational safety plans and protections. Under the Social Security Law, if an insured worker is injured in an accident, the employer must report it to the township social security office. The employer will also need to report to the FGLLID, and hence, a dual reporting system. The SSB investigates the accident and whether the injured worker is insured under the social security system. If the worker is not insured, but the worker should have been insured, and because employer has failed to comply with this requirement, the SSB calculates the amount of benefit due and will require the employer to compensate the same amount to the worker. An insured worker receives the benefit due from the Social Security Fund. Workers insured under the Social Security Law are also entitled to cash benefits during a period of reduced or lost income due to injury and illness, and the details are provided in the next section. All workers with workplace injuries or illness who are not covered by the social security programmes can resort to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. To be compensated under the Workers Compensation Act, an injured worker, or his/her family if the worker is deceased, can submit a case to the township committee on workmen\u2019s compensation. The committee investigates the issue and decides the amount of compensation the employer must pay. The law provides further details regarding notice, reporting, investigation, medical examinations, and compensation. In case of accidents, employers shall offer free medical examinations to workers. Employers are also liable to pay compensation to workers for injuries and diseases arising out of and in the course of employment, provided that, in respect of injury, it should not be directly attributable to:\n \u2022 the worker been under the influence of drink or drugs;\n \u2022 the worker\u2019s wilful disobedience of the safety rules and orders of the employer; or \u2022 the worker\u2019s wilful removal or disregard of safety guards or other devices which he/she knew to have been provided for the purpose of securing his/her safety."

A WCC shall be formed with the view to\nnegotiating and concluding collective agreements.57\nThe number of worker representatives on a WCC will vary according to the number of labour\norganizations that exist in that workplace, and the percentage of workers who are union members.\nHowever, the principal requirements for individual workplaces are that:\n\u2022 In a trade (with more than 30 workers) where one or more labour organization exists, the\nWCC shall comprise three representatives nominated by each labour organization and an\nequivalent number of employer representatives\n\u2022 In a trade (with more than 30 workers) where there is no labour organization, three\nrepresentatives shall be selected by the workers and three employer representatives.\nIn workplaces with both labour organizations and elected worker representatives, the employer\ncannot use the elected non-organized worker representatives to undermine the position of labour\norganizations and labour organization representatives. Members of the WCCs serve for two years\nand each side fills vacancies if members leave the committee.\nLater in this chapter, the role of WCC\u2019s in relation to dispute resolution is discussed further."

        "question": "The process for resolving disputes",
        "answer": "The first step in resolving disputes that fall within the scope of the Settlement of Labour Dispute\nLaw is to try and resolve them at a workplace level. It is important that workers and employers put\nparticular effort into seeking low level solutions as this provides the most cost effective, speedy and\nefficient means of resolving disputes.\nFor workplaces with a WCC, a grievance should be raised by the worker, labour organization or the\nemployer and be settled by the WCC within seven days from the date of receiving the request.\nFor workplaces where there are less than 30 workers (and therefore no WCC), a grievance should\nbe submitted to the employer. The employer shall negotiate and settle with the worker or their\nrepresentative within seven days of receiving the request.\nIf a dispute is settled, the parties can make a collective agreement or make a record of settlement.\nA form for making a record of settlement is provided in the Settlement of Labour Dispute Rules. For\ndisputes that are not settled, s.9 of the Law provides a broad mandate for a complaint to be received\nby a conciliation body.\nSection 12(b) of the Settlement of Labour Disputes Law provides that that the following complaints\nmust be submitted to concerned departments or the competent court:\n\u2022 complaints relating to rights contained and existing labour laws;\n\u2022 complaints not otherwise under the mandate of a conciliation body.\nReaders should note that at the time of publication, that the Rules had not been updated to implement\n2019 revisions to the Settlement of Labour Disputes Law."

        "question": "Composition of conciliation bodies",
        "answer": "Township conciliation bodies have a term of three years and comprise:\n\u2022 a chairperson, assigned by the respective region, state government, Nay Pyi Taw Council or\na self-administered division or self-administered zone;\n\u2022 three employer representatives from basic and township level employer organizations;\n\u2022 three worker representatives from basic and township level workers\u2019 organizations selected\nby basic and township level workers\u2019 organizations;\n\u2022 one government representative from a respective township;\n\u2022 one person assisted by the Ministry who shall be the secretary.\nIf there is no particular law to conciliate disputes in special economic zones, then the procedure\nabove will be applied. Employer organizations and labour organizations are responsible for selecting\nrepresentatives to the conciliation body above. Each side fills vacancies if members leave.\nA conciliation body is required to conciliate complaints or disputes it receives within seven days from\nthe date of its knowledge or acceptance of a case and to prepare a contract of mutual agreement\n(otherwise known as a settlement agreement) if a dispute is settled.\nIf an \u201cinterests\u201d based dispute is not settled, the conciliation body shall refer the dispute to the\nrelevant arbitration body."

        "question": "Arbitration bodies and processes",
        "answer": "The arbitration body must make a decision on \u201cinterests\u201d based disputes within seven days of\nreceiving a case and the ruling must be delivered to the parties within two more days. If the decision\nrelates to essential services or a public utility, a copy must be sent to the ministry and a respective\nregion or state government. If the parties accept the ruling of the arbitration body, the decision is\neffective from the day of the decision.\nIf either party is not satisfied with the decision of an arbitration body, (except for a decision in respect\nof essential services):\n\u2022 an employer can lock-out workers;\n\u2022 workers can strike; or\n\u2022 either party may appeal a decision to the Arbitration Council within seven days.\nWhere a decision relates to an essential service, a party may only apply to the Arbitration Council (and\ndoes not have the right to lock-out or and strike action).\nWhen disputes are brought to the Arbitration Council, an Arbitration Tribunal will be established\nand must rule on the dispute within 14 days (or within seven days for disputes relating to essential\nservices) and deliver its ruling to the parties within two more days. All persons involved in the dispute\nmust comply with the rulings. This includes the legal successors of the employers and all workers in\nthe enterprise(s)."

        "question": "Strikes and lockouts",
        "answer": "The Settlement of Labour Dispute Law and Labour Organization Law both define a strike as a collective\naction taken some or all workers or workers\u2019 organizations resulting in a suspension of work, a refusal\nto work or to continue to work, or a slow-down or other collective actions that are designed to limit\nproduction or services and relates to social or occupational issues. Both laws define a lockout as a\ntemporary closing of the workplace of any sector, suspension of work, or refusal by the employer to\nallow workers to continue to work when the employer and workers are engaged in a dispute.\nThe general rights relating to strikes and lockouts are set out in both laws. However, some\ncomplications arise because of the definition of a \u201cworker\u201d under each is different which affects the\ncoverage of each law.59\nThe procedures to be followed depend on whether the workplace is a public utility service or other\nutility service. Section 12.3 sets out the rules relating to public utility services.\nEmployers and workers are advised to consult both the Labour Organization Law and the Settlement\nof Labour Disputes Law for the process and procedures to be followed for lawful strikes and lockouts.60\nBoth laws set out when workers may go on strike, notice periods and unlawful strikes and lockouts."
